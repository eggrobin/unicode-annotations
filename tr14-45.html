 <h2>1 <a name="Scope" href="#Scope">Overview and Scope</a></h2>

    <p>Line breaking, also known as word wrapping, is the process of breaking a section of
	text into lines such that it will fit in the available width of a page, window or
	other display area. The Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm performs part of this process.
	Given an input text, it produces a set of positions called "break opportunities"
	that are appropriate points to begin a new line. The selection of actual line
	break positions from the set of break opportunities is not covered by the
	Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm, but is in the domain of higher level software
	with knowledge of the available width and the display size of the text.</p>
    <p>The text of the Unicode Standard [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] presents
	a limited description of some of the characters with specific functions in
	line breaking, but does not give a complete specification of line breaking behavior. This annex
	provides more detailed information about default line breaking behavior, reflecting best
	practices for the support of multilingual texts.</p>
    <p>For most Unicode characters, considerable variation in line breaking
	behavior can be expected, including variation based on local or stylistic
	preferences. For that reason, the line breaking properties provided for
	these characters are informative. Some characters are intended to explicitly
	influence line breaking. Their line breaking behavior is therefore expected
	to be identical across all implementations. As described in this annex,
	the Unicode Standard assigns normative line breaking properties to those characters.
	The Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm is a tailorable set of rules that
	uses these line breaking properties in context to determine line break
	opportunities.</p>
    <p>This annex opens with formal definitions, a summary of the line breaking task
	and the context in which it occurs in overall text
	layout, followed by a brief section on conformance requirements.
    Two main sections follow:</p>
    <ul>
	<li><i>Section 5,
	    <a href="#Properties">Line Breaking Properties</a></i>, contains a narrative description of the
	    line breaking behavior of the characters in the Unicode Standard, grouping them in alphabetical
	    order by line breaking class.</li>
	<li><i>Section 6,
            <a href="#Algorithm">Line Breaking Algorithm</a></i>,
            provides a set of rules listed in order of precedence that
	    constitute a line breaking algorithm.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The next sections discuss issues of customization and implementation.</p>
    <ul>
	<li><i>Section 8,
	      <a href="#Customization">Customization</a></i>, provides a discussion of how to tailor the algorithm.</li>
	<li><i>Section 9,
	    <a href="#ImplementationNotes">Implementation Notes</a></i>, provides additional information
	    to implementers using regular expression-based techniques or requiring legacy support for
	    combining marks.</li>
	<li><i>Section 10,
	    <a href="#Testing">Testing</a></i>, describes the test data file that is available
	    for checking implementations of the line breaking algorithm.</li>
	<li><i>Section 11,
	    <a href="#RuleNumbering">Rule Numbering Across Versions</a></i>, documents changes in the numbering of
	    the line breaking rules across Unicode versions.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>2 <a name="Definitions" href="#Definitions">Definitions</a></h2>

      <p>The notation defined in this annex differs somewhat from the
      notation defined elsewhere in the Unicode Standard.</p>
      <p><i>All other notation used here without an
      explicit definition shall be as defined elsewhere in the Unicode
      Standard [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</i></p>

  <p><i><b><a name="LD1" href="#LD1">LD1</a></b>. <b>Line Fitting:</b></i>
  		The process of determining how much text will fit
      on a line of text, given the available space between the margins and the
      actual display width of the text.</p>

  <p><i><b><a name="LD2" href="#LD2">LD2</a></b>. <b>Line Break:</b></i>
  	The position in the text where one line ends and the
      next one starts.</p>

  <p><i><b><a name="LD3" href="#LD3">LD3</a></b>. <b>Line Break Opportunity:</b></i>
  	A place where a line is allowed to end.</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>Whether a given position in the text is a valid line break opportunity depends
	    on the context as well as the line breaking rules in force.</li>
	</ul>

  <p><i><b><a name="LD4" href="#LD4">LD4</a></b>. <b>Line Breaking:</b></i>
  	The process of selecting one among several line
	break opportunities such that the resulting line is optimal or ends at a
      user-requested explicit line break.</p>

  <p><i><b><a name="LD5" href="#LD5">LD5</a></b>. <b>Line Breaking Property:</b></i>
  	A character property with enumerated
      values, as listed in <i><a href="#Table1">Table 1</a></i>, and separated into normative and informative
	values.</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Line breaking property values are used to classify characters and, taken in context,
	      determine the type of line break opportunity.</li>
	</ul>

  <p><i><b><a name="LD6" href="#LD6">LD6</a></b>. <b>Line Breaking Class:</b></i>
	A class of characters with the same line breaking property value.</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>The line breaking classes are described in
        <i>Section 5.1, <a href="#DescriptionOfProperties">Description of Line Breaking Properties</a></i>.</li>
    </ul>

  <p><i><b><a name="LD7" href="#LD7">LD7</a></b>. <b>Mandatory Break:</b></i>
  	A line must break following a character that has the mandatory break property.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Such a break is also known as a <i>forced</i> break and is
	  indicated in the rules as <b>B !</b>, where <b>B</b> is the character with the
	  mandatory break property.</li>
    </ul>

  <p><i><b><a name="LD8" href="#LD8">LD8</a></b>. <b>Direct Break:</b></i>
  	A line break opportunity exists between two
	  adjacent characters of the given line breaking classes.</p>

     <ul>
	<li>A direct break is indicated in
	the rules below as<b> B</b> ÷ <b>A</b>, where <b>B</b> is the character class
	of the character <i>before</i> and <b>A</b> is the character class of the
	character<i> after</i> the break. If they are separated by one or more space
	characters, a break opportunity exists instead after the last space.
    </ul>

  <p><i><b><a name="LD9" href="#LD9">LD9</a></b>. <b>Indirect Break:</b></i>
	A line break opportunity exists between two
      characters of the given line breaking classes <i>only</i> if they are
      separated by one or more spaces.</p>

    <ul>
	<li>For an indirect break, a break opportunity exists
	    after the last space. No break opportunity exists if the characters are
	    immediately adjacent. </li>
	<li>In the notation of the rules in
	    <i>Section 6, <a href="#Algorithm">Line Breaking Algorithm</a></i>,
	    an indirect break is represented as two
	    rules: <b>B</b> × <b>A</b> <i>and</i> <b>B</b> <a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a><b>+ ÷ A</b>
	    where the “+” sign means one or more occurrences.</li>
    </ul>

  <p><i><b><a name="LD10" href="#LD10">LD10</a></b>. <b>Prohibited Break:</b></i>
	No line break opportunity exists between two
      characters of the given line breaking classes, even if they are separated
      by one or more space characters.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In the notation of the rules in
	  <i>Section 6, <a href="#Algorithm">Line Breaking Algorithm</a></i>, 
    a prohibited break is expressed as a rule of the form:
	  <b>B</b> <a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a><b>* × A</b>.</li>
    </ul>

  <p><i><b><a name="LD11" href="#LD11">LD11</a></b>. <b>Hyphenation:</b></i>
	Hyphenation uses language-specific rules to provide
      additional line break opportunities <i>within</i> a word.</p>

    <ul>
	<li>Hyphenation improves
	the layout of narrow columns, especially for languages with many longer
	words, such as German or Finnish. For the purpose of this annex, it is
	assumed that hyphenation is equivalent to inserting <em>soft hyphen</em>
        characters. All other aspects of hyphenation are outside the scope of this annex.</li>
    </ul>

<p><i>Table 1</i> lists all of line breaking classes by name, also
	giving their class abbreviation and their status as
	tailorable or not. The examples and brief indication of line breaking
	behavior in this table are merely typical, not exhaustive.
        <i>Section 5.1, <a href="#DescriptionOfProperties">Description of Line Breaking Properties</a></i>,
	provides a detailed description of each line breaking class, including
	detailed overview of the line breaking behavior for characters of that
	class.</p>

  <h2>3 <a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

  <p>Lines are broken as the result of two conditions.
      The first is the presence of a mandatory line breaking character. The second
      condition results from a formatting algorithm having selected among available
      line break opportunities; ideally the chosen line break results in the optimal
      layout of the text.</p>
  <p>Different formatting algorithms may use different methods to determine an
      optimal line break. For example, simple implementations consider a single line at a
      time, trying to find a <i>locally optimal</i> line break. A basic, yet widely
      used approach is to
      allow no compression or expansion of the intercharacter and interword spaces
      and consider the longest line that fits. More complex formatting algorithms
      often take into account the interaction of line
      breaking decisions for the whole paragraph. The well-known text layout system
      [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#TeX">T<sub>E</sub>X</a>] implements an
      example of such a <i>globally
      optimal</i> strategy that may make complex tradeoffs across an entire
      paragraph to avoid unnecessary
      hyphenation and other legal, but inferior breaks. For a description of this
      strategy, see [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Knuth78">Knuth78</a>].</p>
   <p>When compression or expansion is allowed,
      a locally optimal line break seeks to balance the relative merits
      of the resulting amounts of compression and expansion for different line break
      candidates. When expanding or compressing interword space according to common
      typographical practice, only the spaces marked by
      U+0020 SPACE and U+00A0  NO-BREAK SPACE are subject
      to compression, and only spaces marked by U+0020 SPACE,
      U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE,
      and occasionally spaces marked by U+2009 THIN SPACE
      are subject to expansion. All other space characters normally have
      fixed width. When expanding or compressing intercharacter space, the presence
      of U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE or U+2060 WORD JOINER is always ignored.</p>
  <p>Local custom or document style determines whether and to what degree expansion of
	intercharacter space
	is allowed in justifying a line. In languages, such as German, where
  intercharacter space is commonly used to mark e&nbsp;m&nbsp;p&nbsp;h&nbsp;a&nbsp;s&nbsp;i&nbsp;s
	(like this), allowing variable intercharacter spacing would
  have the unintended effect of adding random emphasis, and is therefore best
  avoided. In table headings that use Han ideographs, even extreme
  amounts of intercharacter space commonly occur as short texts are spread out
  across the entire available space to distribute the characters evenly from end
  to end.</p>
    <p>In line breaking it is necessary to distinguish
        between three related tasks.
        The first is the determination of all legal line
        break opportunities, given a string of text. This is the scope of the
        Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm. The second task is the selection of the actual
        location for breaking a given line of text. This selection not only takes
        into account the width of the line compared to the width of the text, but
        may also apply an additional prioritization of line breaks based on
        aesthetic and other criteria. What defines an optimal choice for a given
        line break is outside the scope of this annex, as are methods for its
        selection. The third is the possible justification of lines,
        once actual locations for line breaking have been determined, and is also
        out of scope for the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm.</p>
    <p>Finally, text layout systems may support an emergency mode that
        handles the case of an unusual line that contains no
        otherwise permitted line break
        opportunities. In such line layout emergencies, line breaks may be placed with
        no regard to the ordinary line breaking behavior of the characters involved.
        The details of such an emergency mode are outside
        the scope of this annex, however, it is recommended that grapheme clusters
        be kept together.</p>

<h3>3.1 <a name="BreakOpportunities" href="#BreakOpportunities">Determining Line Break Opportunities</a></h3>

  <p>Three principal styles of context analysis determine line break
  opportunities.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><i>Western:</i> spaces and hyphens are used to determine breaks</li>
    <li><i>East Asian:</i> lines can break anywhere, unless prohibited</li>
    <li><i>South East Asian:</i> line breaks require morphological analysis</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Western style is commonly used for scripts employing the space character.
  Hyphenation is often used with space-based line breaking to provide additional
  line break opportunities—however, it requires knowledge of the language and
  it may need user interaction or overrides.</p>
  <p>The second style of context analysis is used with East Asian ideographic and
  syllabic scripts. In these scripts, lines can break anywhere, except
	before or after certain characters. The precise set of prohibited line
	breaks may depend on user preference or local custom and is commonly
	tailorable.</p>
  <p>Korean makes use of both styles of line break. When Korean text is justified, the second style is
    commonly used, even for interspersed Latin letters. But when ragged margins
    are used, the Western style (relying on spaces) is commonly used instead, even
    for ideographs.</p>
  <p>The third style is used for scripts such as Thai, which do not use spaces,
  but which restrict word breaks to syllable boundaries, whose
  determination requires knowledge of the language comparable to that required by a
  hyphenation algorithm. Such an algorithm is beyond the scope of the Unicode
  Standard.</p>
  <p>For multilingual text, the Western and East Asian styles can be unified into a single set
  of specifications, based on the information in this annex. Unicode characters have explicit line breaking properties assigned to them.
  These properties can be utilized to implement the effect of both of these two styles of context analysis for line break
  opportunities. Customization for user preferences or document style can
  then be achieved by tailoring that specification.</p>
  <p>In bidirectional text, line breaks are determined before applying rule L1 of the Unicode Bidirectional
    Algorithm [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX9">UAX9</a>].
    However, line breaking is strictly independent of directional properties of
    the characters or of any auxiliary information determined by the application
    of rules of that algorithm.</p>

<h2>4 <a name="Conformance" href="#Conformance">Conformance</a></h2>

	<p>There is no single method for determining line breaks; the rules may
        differ based on user preference and document layout. The information
        in this annex, including the specification of the line breaking algorithm,
        allows for the necessary flexibility in determining line breaks according to
        different conventions. However, some characters
        have been encoded explicitly for their effect on line breaking.

	Because users adding such characters to a text expect that they will have
	the desired effect, these characters have been given required line breaking behavior.</p>

	<p>To handle certain situations, some line
	breaking implementations use techniques that cannot be expressed within the
	framework of the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm. Examples
	include using dictionaries of words for languages that do not use
	spaces, such as Thai; recognition of the language
	of the text in order to choose among different punctuation conventions;
	using dictionaries of common abbreviations or contractions to resolve
	ambiguities with periods or apostrophes; or a deeper analysis of common
	syntaxes for numbers or dates, and so on. The conformance requirements permit variations of this kind.</p>

	<p>Processes which support multiple modes for
	determining line breaks are also accommodated. This situation can arise with
	marked-up text, rich text, style sheets, or other environments in which a
	higher-level protocol can carry formatting instructions that prevent or
	force line breaks in positions that differ from those specified by the
	Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm. The approach taken here
	requires that such processes have a conforming default line break behavior, and to
	disclose that they also include
	overrides or optional behaviors that are invoked via a higher-level protocol.</p>

	<p>The methods by which a line layout process
	chooses optimal line breaks from among the available break opportunities is
	outside the scope of this specification. The behavior of a line layout
	process in situations where there are no suitable break opportunities is
	also outside of the scope of this specification.</p>

    <p><span class="note">Note</span>:
    Locale-sensitive line break specifications can be expressed in LDML [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS35">UTS35</a>].
    Tailorings are available in the Common Locale Data Repository [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#CLDR">CLDR</a>].</p>


	<h3>4.1 <a name="ConfRequirements" href="#ConfRequirements">Conformance Requirements</a></h3>

	   <p><i><b><a name="UAX14-C1" href="#UAX14-C1">UAX14-C1</a></b>. A process that determines line breaks in
	Unicode text, and that purports to implement the Unicode Line Breaking
	Algorithm, shall do so in accordance with the specifications in this annex.
	In particular, the following three subconditions shall be met:</i></p>
	<ol>
	<li><i>The sets of mandatory break positions and of break opportunities which
	    the implementation produces include all of those specified by the rules in
	    Section 6.1,
	    <a href="#BreakingRules">Non-tailorable Line Breaking Rules</a>.</i></li>
	<li><i>There exist no break opportunities or mandatory breaks produced by the
	    implementation that fall on a &quot;non-break&quot; position specified by the rules in
	    Section 6.1,
	    <a href="#BreakingRules">Non-tailorable Line Breaking Rules</a>.</i></li>
	<li><i>If the implementation tailors the behavior
		of Section 6.2,
	    <a href="#TailorableBreakingRules">Tailorable Line Breaking Rules</a>,
		that fact must be disclosed.</i></li>
	</ol>
	<p><i><b><a name="UAX14-C2" href="#UAX14-C2">UAX14-C2</a></b>. If an implementation
	has a default line breaking operation which conforms to <a href="#UAX14-C1">UAX14-C1</a>, but also
	has overrides based on a higher-level protocol, that fact must be disclosed
	and any behavior that differs from that specified by the rules of Section 6.1,
	    <a href="#BreakingRules">Non-tailorable Line Breaking Rules</a>,
	must be documented.</i></p>
	<blockquote>
	    <p>Example: An XML format provides markup which disables all line breaking over
	    some span of text. When the markup is not in place, the default behavior is
	    in conformance according to <a href="#UAX14-C1">UAX14-C1</a>. As long as the existence of the option
	    is disclosed, that format can be said to conform to the Unicode
	    Line Breaking Algorithm according to <a href="#UAX14-C2">UAX14-C2</a>.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>As is the case for all other Unicode
	algorithms, this specification is a logical description—particular
	implementations can have more efficient mechanisms as long as they produce
	the same results. See C18 in <i>Chapter 3, Conformance</i>, of
	[<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].
	While only disclosure of tailorings is required in the conformance clauses,
	documentation of the differences in behaviors is strongly encouraged.</p>

<h2>5 <a name="Properties" href="#Properties">Line Breaking Properties</a></h2>

  <p>This section provides detailed narrative descriptions of
      the line breaking behavior of many Unicode characters.
      Many descriptions in this section provide additional
      informative detail about handling a given character at the end of a line, or during
	line layout, which goes beyond the simple
	determination of line breaks. In some cases, the
	text also gives guidance as to preferred characters for achieving a particular
	effect in line breaking.</p>

	<p>This section also summarizes the membership of character
	  classes corresponding to each value of the line breaking property. Note
	that the mnemonic names for the line break classes are intended neither as
	exhaustive descriptions of their membership nor as indicators of their
	entire range of behaviors in the line breaking process. Instead, their main
	purpose is to serve as unique, yet broadly mnemonic labels. In other words,
	as long as their line breaking behavior is identical, otherwise unrelated
	characters will be grouped together in the same line break class.</p>

	<p>The classification
	by property values defined in this section and in the data file is used as input
	into the algorithm defined in
	<i>Section 6, <a href="#Algorithm">Line Breaking Algorithm</a></i>. 
  That section describes
    a workable default line breaking method.
	<i>Section 8, <a href="#Customization">Customization</a></i>,
	discusses how the default line breaking behavior can be tailored to the
	needs of specific languages or for particular document styles and user preferences.
  Permitted customizations can include changing the classification 
    of characters for certain classes.</p>

  <p>In addition to the line breaking properties defined in this section, 
    the algorithm defined in <i>Section 6, <a href="#Algorithm">Line Breaking Algorithm</a></i> also makes use of 
    East_Asian_Width property values, defined in 
    Unicode Standard Annex #11, <i>East Asian Width</i> [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX11">UAX11</a>]. 
    Note that for purposes of the line breaking algorithm, those East_Asian_Width property 
    values are tailorable, as are the rules of the line breaking algorithm which use them.
    (See rule <a class="charclass" href="#LB30">LB30</a>.)</p>

  <h4>Data File</h4>

  <p>The full classification of all Unicode characters by their line breaking
      properties is available in
      the file LineBreak.txt [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Data14">Data14</a>] in the Unicode
      Character Database [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UCD">UCD</a>].
      This is a semicolon-delimited,
      two-column, plain text file, with code position and line breaking class. A
      comment at the end of each line indicates the character name.</p>

  <p>The line break property assignments from the data file are normative. The descriptions
     of the line break classes in this UAX include examples of representative or interesting characters
     for each class, but for the complete list always refer to the data file.</p>

  <h4>Future Updates</h4>
	<p>As scripts are added to the Unicode Standard and become more widely implemented,
	line breaking classes may be added or the assignment of line breaking class may be changed for some characters.
	Implementers must not make any assumptions to the contrary.
        Any future updates will be reflected in the
        <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/LineBreak.txt">latest version</a> of the data file.
        (See the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode Character Database</a>
        [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UCD">UCD</a>] for any specific version of the data file.)</p>

<h3>5.1 <a name="DescriptionOfProperties" href="#DescriptionOfProperties">Description of Line Breaking Properties</a></h3>

  <p>Line breaking classes are listed alphabetically. Each line breaking class
	is marked with an annotation in parentheses with the following meanings:</p>

<div align="center">
	<table class="subtle">
		<tr>
			<th>Label</th>
			<th>Meaning for the Class</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(A)</td>
			<td>It <b>allows</b> a break opportunity <b>after</b> in specified contexts.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(XA)</td>
			<td>It <b>prevents</b> a break opportunity <b>after</b> in specified contexts.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(B)</td>
			<td>It <b>allows</b> a break opportunity <b>before</b> in specified contexts.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(XB)</td>
			<td>It <b>prevents</b> a break opportunity <b>before</b> in specified contexts.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(P)</td>
			<td>It <b>allows</b> a break opportunity for a <b>pair</b> of same characters.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(XP)</td>
			<td>It <b>prevents</b> a break opportunity for a <b>pair</b> of same characters.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>

<blockquote>
    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> The use of the letters <b>B</b> and <b>A</b> in these annotations
	marks the position of the break opportunity relative to the character. It is
	not to be confused with the use of the same letters in the other parts of
	this annex, where they indicate the positions of the characters relative to
	the break opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>

  <h3><b><a name="AI" href="#AI">AI</a></b>: Ambiguous (Alphabetic or Ideograph)</h3>
  <p>Some characters that ordinarily act like
	alphabetic characters are treated like ideographs (line breaking class
	<a class="charclass" href="#ID"> ID</a>) in certain East Asian legacy contexts.
	Their line breaking behavior
	therefore depends on the context. In the absence of appropriate context information,
	they are treated as class <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>; see
	the note at the end of this description.</p>

	<p>As originally defined, the line break class <a class="charclass" href="#AI">AI</a> contained <i>all</i>
	characters with East_Asian_Width value A (ambiguous width) that
        would otherwise be <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a> in this
	classification. For more information on East_Asian_Width and how to
	resolve it, see Unicode Standard Annex #11,
	<i>East Asian Width</i> [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX11">UAX11</a>].</p>

	<p>The original definition included many Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic
	characters. These characters are now classified by default as <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>
	because use of the <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>
	line breaking class better corresponds to modern practice. Where strict
	compatibility with older legacy implementations is desired, some of these
	characters need to be
	treated as <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a> in certain contexts. This can be done by always tailoring them
	to <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a> or by continuing to classify
	them as <a class="charclass" href="#AI">AI</a> and resolving them to <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a>
	where required.</p>

	<p>As part of the same
	revision, the set of ambiguous characters has been extended to completely encompass
	the enclosed alphanumeric characters used for numbering of bullets.</p>

	<p>As updated, the <a class="charclass" href="#AI">AI</a> line breaking
	class includes all characters with East Asian Width A that are outside the range U+0000..U+1FFF, plus the following
	characters:</p>

  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">24EA</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">CIRCLED DIGIT ZERO</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2780..2793</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">DINGBAT CIRCLED SANS-SERIF DIGIT ONE..DINGBAT NEGATIVE CIRCLED SANS-SERIF NUMBER TEN</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Characters with the line break class <a class="charclass" href="#AI">AI</a>
	with East_Asian_Width value A typically take the
	<a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a> line breaking class
	when their resolved East_Asian_Width is N (narrow) and take the
	line breaking class <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a> when their
	resolved width is W (wide). The remaining
	characters are then resolved to <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>
	or <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a> in a consistent fashion.
	The details of this resolution are not specified in this annex. The line breaking rules in
        <i>Section 6, <a href="#Algorithm">Line Breaking Algorithm</a></i>
	merely require that all ambiguous characters be resolved appropriately as part of
        assigning line breaking classes to the input characters.</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> The canonical decompositions of characters of class
	    <a class="charclass" href="#AI">AI</a> are not necessarily of class
	    <a class="charclass" href="#AI">AI</a> themselves.
	    The East_Asian_Width property A on which the definition of
	    <a class="charclass" href="#AI">AI</a> is largely based, does not preserve canonical equivalence.
	    In the context of line breaking, the fact that a character has been assigned
	    class <a class="charclass" href="#AI">AI</a> means that the line break implementation must resolve it to either
	    <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a> or
	    <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a>, in the
	    absence of further tailoring. If
	    preserving canonical equivalence is desired, an implementation is free to
	    make sure that the <i>resolved</i> line break classes preserve canonical
	    equivalence. Unless compatibility with particular legacy behavior is
	    important, it may be sufficient to
	    map all such characters to <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>. This
	    achieves a canonically equivalent resolution of line breaking classes, and
	    is compatible with emerging modern practice that treats these characters
	    increasingly like regular alphabetic characters.</p>
	    </blockquote>

<h3><b><a name="AL" href="#AL">AL</a></b>: Ordinary Alphabetic and Symbol Characters (XP)</h3>
      <p>Ordinary characters require other characters to provide break opportunities; otherwise, no
        line breaks are allowed between pairs of them. However, this behavior is tailorable. In
	some Far Eastern documents, it may be desirable to allow breaking between
	pairs of ordinary characters—particularly Latin characters and symbols.</p>

      <blockquote>
            <p><span class="note">Note:</span> Use ZWSP as a manual override to provide break
                opportunities around alphabetic or symbol characters.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This class contains alphabetic or symbolic characters not explicitly assigned to another line breaking class. These are primarily characters of the following categories:</p>
    <div align="center">
    	<table class="subtle">
    		<tr>
    			<th>Category</th>
    			<th>General_Category Values</th>
    		</tr>
    		<tr>
    			<td>Alphabetic</td>
    			<td>Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, and Lo</td>
    		</tr>
    		<tr>
    			<td>Symbols</td>
    			<td>Sm, Sk, and So</td>
    		</tr>
    		<tr>
    			<td>Non-decimal Numbers</td>
    			<td>Nl and No</td>
    		</tr>
    		<tr>
    			<td>Punctuation</td>
    			<td>Pc, Pd, and Po</td>
    		</tr>
    	</table>
    </div>
    <p>Line break class <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a> also contains several format characters, including:</p>
        <table class="noborder">
          <tr>
            <td class="nb-la">0600..0604</td>
            <td class="nb-lb">ARABIC NUMBER SIGN..ARABIC SIGN SAMVAT</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="nb-la">06DD</td>
            <td class="nb-lb">ARABIC END OF AYAH</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="nb-la">070F</td>
            <td class="nb-lb">SYRIAC ABBREVIATION MARK</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="nb-la">2061..2064</td>
            <td class="nb-lb">FUNCTION APPLICATION..INVISIBLE PLUS</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="nb-la">110BD</td>
            <td class="nb-lb">KAITHI NUMBER SIGN</td>
          </tr>
  </table>
  	<blockquote>
        <p>These format characters occur in the middle or at the beginning of words or alphanumeric or symbol sequences. However, when alphabetic characters are tailored to allow breaks, these characters should not allow breaks after.</p>
    </blockquote>
<p>Major exceptions to the general pattern of alphabetic and symbolic characters having line break class <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a> include:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>HL for Hebrew letters<br>
AI or ID, based on the East Asian Width property of the character<br>
ID for  certain pictographic symbols<br>
CJ for small hiragana and katakana<br>SA for complex context scripts<br>JL, JV, JT, H2 or H3 for Hangul characters</p>
    </blockquote>
<h3><b><a name="BA" href="#BA">BA</a></b>: Break After (A)</h3>
  <p>Like SPACE, the characters in this class provide a break opportunity; unlike
	SPACE, they do not take part in determining indirect breaks.
      They can be subdivided into several categories.</p>

<h4><b><i>Breaking Spaces</i></b></h4>
  <p>Breaking spaces are a subset of characters with General_Category Zs.  Examples include:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">1680</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">OGHAM SPACE MARK</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2000</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">EN QUAD</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2001</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">EM QUAD</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2002</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">EN SPACE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2003</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">EM SPACE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2004</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">THREE-PER-EM SPACE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2005</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">FOUR-PER-EM SPACE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2006</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">SIX-PER-EM SPACE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2008</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">PUNCTUATION SPACE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2009</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">THIN SPACE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">200A</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">HAIR SPACE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">205F</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">MEDIUM MATHEMATICAL SPACE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">3000</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

    <p>All of these space characters have a specific width, but
      otherwise behave as breaking spaces. In setting a justified line, none of these spaces
    normally changes in width, except for THIN SPACE
    when used in mathematical notation. See also the <a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a> property.</p>

   <p>The OGHAM SPACE MARK may be rendered visibly between words but it is
    recommended that it be elided at the end of a line. For more information,
    see <i>Section 5.7, <a href="#WordSeparators">Word Separator Characters</a></i>.</p>

        <p>For a list of all space characters in the Unicode Standard, see <i>Section 6.2, General Punctuation</i>,
        in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>

<h4>Tabs</h4>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">0009</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">TAB</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Except for the effect of the location of the tab stops, the tab character
  acts similarly to a space for the purpose of line breaking.</p>

<h4>Conditional Hyphens</h4>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">00AD</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">SOFT HYPHEN (SHY)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>SHY is an invisible format character with no width. It marks
    the place where an optional line break may occur inside a word.
    It can be used with all scripts. If a line is broken at an optional
    line break position marked by a SHY, the text at that line break
    position often has a modified appearance as described in
    <i>Section 5.4, <a href="#SoftHyphen">Use of Soft Hyphen</a></i>.</p>

<h4>Breaking Hyphens</h4>
  <p>Breaking hyphens establish explicit break opportunities immediately after
  each occurrence.</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">058A</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">ARMENIAN HYPHEN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2010</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">HYPHEN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2012</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">FIGURE DASH</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2013</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">EN DASH</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Hyphens are graphic characters with width. Because, unlike spaces, they
      are visible, they are included in the measured part of the preceding line, except
      where the layout style allows hyphens to hang into the margins.
	For additional
	information about how to format line breaks resulting from the presence of hyphens, see
	<i>Section 5.3, <a href="#Hyphen">Use of Hyphen</a></i>.</p>

<h4>Visible Word Dividers</h4>
    <p>The following are examples of other forms of visible word dividers that
    provide break opportunities:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">05BE</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">HEBREW PUNCTUATION MAQAF</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">0F0B</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">TIBETAN MARK INTERSYLLABIC TSHEG</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">1361</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">17D8</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">KHMER SIGN BEYYAL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">17DA</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">KHMER SIGN KOOMUUT</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

    <p>The Tibetan <i>tsheg</i> is a visible mark, but it functions effectively
        like a space to separate words (or other units) in Tibetan. It provides a
        break opportunity after itself. For additional
        information, see <i>Section 5.6, <a href="#TibetanLinebreaking">Tibetan Line Breaking</a></i>.</p>

      <p>The ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE is a visible word delimiter and is kept on the
      previous line. In contrast, U+1360 ETHIOPIC SECTION MARK is typically
      used in a sequence of several such marks on a separate line, and separated by spaces. As such
	lines are typically marked with separate hard line breaks (<a class="charclass" href="#BK">BK</a>),
	the section mark is treated like an ordinary symbol and given line break
	class <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>.</p>

      <table class="noborder">
        <tr>
          <td class="nb-la">2027</td>
          <td class="nb-lb">HYPHENATION POINT</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

  <p>A hyphenation point is a raised dot, which is mainly used in dictionaries
	and similar works to visibly indicate syllabification of words. Syllable
	breaks frequently also are potential line break opportunities in the middle of words.
	When an actual line break falls inside a word containing hyphenation
        point characters, the hyphenation point is usually rendered as a regular hyphen at the
        end of the line.</p>

  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">007C</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">VERTICAL LINE</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>In some dictionaries, a vertical bar is used instead of a hyphenation
      point. In this usage, U+0323 COMBINING DOT BELOW is
	used to mark stressed syllables, so all breaks are marked by the vertical
	bar. For an actual line break
	the vertical bar is rendered as a hyphen at the end of the line.</p>

<h4>Historic Word Separators</h4>
	<p>Historic texts, especially ancient ones, often do not use spaces, even
	for scripts where modern use of spaces is standard. Special punctuation was
	used to mark word boundaries in such texts. For modern text processing it is
	recommended to treat these as line break opportunities by default. <a class="charclass" href="#WJ">WJ</a> can
	be used to override this default, where necessary.</p>

        <p>Examples of Historic Word Separators include:</p>

   <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
        <td class="nb-la">16EB</td>
        <td class="nb-lb">RUNIC SINGLE PUNCTUATION</td>

      <td class="nb-la">16EC</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2056</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">THREE DOT PUNCTUATION</td>

<h4>Dandas</h4>
    <p>DEVANAGARI DANDA is similar to a
	full stop. The <i>danda</i> or historically related symbols are used with several other
	Indic scripts. Unlike a full stop, the <i>danda</i> is not used in number
	formatting. DEVANAGARI DOUBLE DANDA marks the end of a verse. It also has
	analogues in other scripts.</p>

    <p>Examples of dandas include:</p>

<h4>Other Terminating Punctuation</h4>

	it. This is similar to <a class="charclass" href="#EX">EX</a>, except that
	the latter may be separated by a space from the preceding word without
	allowing a break, whereas these marks are used without spaces.

  <p>In some dictionaries, stressed syllables are indicated with a spacing acute

      The oxia is canonically equivalent to the acute accent.</p>

  <p>A cross accent also appears in some dictionaries to mark the stress of the following
        syllable, and should be handled in the same way as the other stress marking
        characters in this section.  The accent should not be separated from the
        syllable it marks by a break.</p>

    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2014</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">EM DASH</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The EM DASH is used to set off
      parenthetical text. Normally, it is used without spaces. However, this is language dependent.
	For example, in Swedish, spaces are used around
      the EM DASH. Line breaks can occur
      before and after an EM DASH. Because EM DASHes
	are sometimes used in pairs instead of a single quotation dash, the default
	behavior is not to break the line between even though not all
      fonts use connecting glyphs for the
      EM DASH.</p>

      <p>Some languages, including Spanish, use EM DASH to set off
         a parenthetical, and the surrounding dashes should not be broken from the contained text.
         In this usage there is space on the side where it can be broken. This does not conflict with
         symmetrical usages, either with spaces  on both sides of the em-dash or with no spaces.</p>

  <h3><b><a name="BK" href="#BK">BK</a></b>: Mandatory Break (A) (Non-tailorable)</h3>
  <p>Explicit breaks act independently of the surrounding characters.
	No characters can be added to the <a class="charclass" href="#BK">BK</a> class as
	part of tailoring, but implementations are not required to support the VT
	character.

  </table>
  <p>The text of the new paragraph starts at the beginning of the line.
  This character defines a paragraph break, causing suitable formatting to be

    LINE SEPARATOR, FF, VT as well as <a class="charclass" href="#CR">CR</a>,
	<a class="charclass" href="#LF">LF</a> and <a class="charclass" href="#NL">
	NL</a> do not define a paragraph break.</p>
  <h4>Newline Function (NLF)</h4>
  <p>Newline Functions are defined in the Unicode
	Standard as providing additional mandatory breaks. They are not
    individual characters, but are encoded as sequences of the control characters
    NEL, LF, and CR. If a character sequence for a
	Newline Function contains more than one character, it is kept together.
	The particular sequences that form an NLF
	depend on the implementation and other circumstances as described in <i>Section 5.8,
	Newline Guidelines</i>, of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  <p>This specification defines the NLF implicitly. It
	defines the three character
	classes <a class="charclass" href="#CR">CR</a>,
	<a class="charclass" href="#LF">LF</a>, and <a class="charclass" href="#NL">NL</a>. Their line
	break behavior, defined in rule <a class="charclass" href="#LB5">LB5</a> in <i>Section 6.1,
	<a href="#BreakingRules">Non-tailorable Line Breaking Rules</a></i>, is to
	break after <a class="charclass" href="#NL">NL</a>,
	<a class="charclass" href="#LF">LF</a>,
	or <a class="charclass" href="#CR">CR</a>, but not between
	<a class="charclass" href="#CR">CR</a> and <a class="charclass" href="#LF"> LF</a>.</p>

<h3><b><a name="CB" href="#CB">CB</a></b>: Contingent Break Opportunity (B/A)</h3>
  <p>By default, there is a break opportunity both <i>before</i> and <i>after</i>
	any inline object. Object-specific line breaking behavior is implemented in
	the associated object itself, and where available can override the default
	to prevent either or both of the default break opportunities. Using U+FFFC
	OBJECT REPLACEMENT CHARACTER allows the object
	anchor to take a character position in the string.</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">FFFC</td>
      <td class="nb-lb">OBJECT REPLACEMENT CHARACTER</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Object-specific line break behavior is best implemented by
	querying the object itself, not by replacing the <a class="charclass" href="#CB"> CB</a> line breaking class by
	another class.</p>

<h3><b><a name="CJ" href="#CJ">CJ</a></b>: Conditional Japanese Starter</h3>
   <p>This character class contains Japanese small hiragana and katakana. Characters of this class may be treated
      as either <a class="charclass" href="#NS">NS</a> or <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a>.</p>
   <p>CSS Text Level 3 (which supports Japanese line layout) defines three distinct values
    for its line-break behavior:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>strict, typically used for long lines</li>
          <li>normal (CSS default), the behavior typically used for books and documents</li>
          <li>loose, typically used for short lines such as in newspapers</li>
       </ul>
    <p>These have different sets of “kinsoku” characters which cannot be at the beginning or end of
        a line; strict has the largest set, while loose has the smallest. The motivation for the smaller
        number of kinsoku characters is to avoid triggering justification that puts characters off the grid
        position.</p>
    <p>Treating characters of class <a class="charclass" href="#CJ">CJ</a>
        as class <a class="charclass" href="#NS">NS</a> will give CSS strict line breaking;
        treating them as class <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a> will give CSS normal breaking.</p>

    <p>The <a class="charclass" href="#CJ">CJ</a> line break class includes</p>

<h3><b><a name="CL" href="#CL">CL</a></b>: Close Punctuation (XB)</h3>
  <p>The closing character of any set of paired punctuation should be kept with
      the preceding character, and the same applies to all forms of wide comma and
      full stop. This is desirable, even when there are
	intervening space characters, to prevent the appearance of a bare
	closing punctuation mark at the head of a line.</p>

        <p>The class <a class="charclass" href="#CL">CL</a> is closely related to the class
           <a class="charclass" href="#CP">CP</a> (Close Parenthesis).  They differ only in that
            <a class="charclass" href="#CP">CP</a> will not introduce a break when followed
            by a letter or number, which prevents breaks within constructs like “(s)he”.</p>

        <p>The <a class="charclass" href="#CL">CL</a> line break class contains characters
        of General_Category Pe in the Unicode Character Database, but

<h3><b><a name="CM" href="#CM">CM</a></b>: Combining Mark (XB) (Non-tailorable)</h3>
  <h4>Combining Characters</h4>
  <p>Combining character sequences are treated as units for the purpose of line
  breaking. The line breaking behavior of the sequence is that of the base
  character.</p>
	<p>The preferred base character for showing combining
	marks in isolation is U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE.
        If a line break before or after the combining sequence is desired, U+200B
	ZERO WIDTH SPACE
	can be used. The use of U+0020 SPACE as a base character
	is deprecated.</p>

	<p>For most purposes, combining characters take on
	the properties of their base characters, and that is how the <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM</a> class is
	treated in rule <a class="charclass" href="#LB9">LB9</a> of this specification.
        As a result, if the sequence &lt;0021, 20E4&gt; is
	used to represent a triangle enclosing an exclamation point, it
	is effectively treated as <a class="charclass" href="#EX">EX</a>, the line
	break class of the exclamation mark. If U+2061 CAUTION SIGN
	had been used, which also looks like an exclamation point inside a triangle,
	it would have the line break class of <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>.
	Only the latter corresponds to the line breaking behavior expected by
	users for this symbol. To
	avoid surprising behavior, always use a base character that is a symbol
	or letter (Line Break <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>) when
	using enclosing combining marks (General_Category Me).</p>

        <p>The <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM</a> line break class includes all
        combining characters with General_Category Mc, Me, and Mn, unless listed
	explicitly elsewhere. This includes <i>viramas</i>.</p>

    <h4>Control and Formatting Characters</h4>
        <p>Most control and formatting characters are ignored in line breaking and do
        not contribute to the line width. By giving them class <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM</a>, the line breaking
        behavior of the last preceding character that is not of class <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM</a> affects the
        line breaking behavior.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><span class="note">Note:</span> When control codes and format characters
                are rendered visibly during editing, more graceful layout might be achieved
                by treating them as if they had the line break
                class of the visible symbols instead, that is
                <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a> or <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a>.
                Such visible modes do not violate
                the constraint on tailorability, because they are logically equivalent to
                having temporarily substituted symbol <i>characters</i>, such as the
                characters from the Control Pictures block, or in some cases, character
                sequences, for the actual control characters.</p>
          </blockquote>

       <p>The <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM</a> line break class includes all characters
       of General_Category Cc and Cf, unless listed explicitly elsewhere.</p>

       <p>The <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM</a> class also includes
       U+3035 VERTICAL KANA REPEAT MARK LOWER HALF. This character is
       normally preceded by either U+3033 VERTICAL KANA REPEAT MARK UPPER HALF
       or U+3034 VERTICAL KANA REPEAT WITH VOICED SOUND MARK UPPER HALF,
       and should not be separated from them.</p>

<h3><b><a name="CP" href="#CP">CP</a></b>: Closing Parenthesis (XB)</h3>
   <p>This class contains just two characters, U+0029 RIGHT PARENTHESIS
        and U+005D RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET.
        Characters of class <a class="charclass" href="#CP">CP</a> differ from those of the
        <a class="charclass" href="#CL">CL</a> (Close Punctuation) class
        in that they will not cause a break opportunity when appearing in contexts like “(s)he.”
        In all other respects the breaking behavior of <a class="charclass" href="#CP">CP</a> and
        <a class="charclass" href="#CL">CL</a> are the same.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="note">Note:</span> On some platforms the character sequence
            &lt;CR, CR, LF&gt; is used to indicate
            the location of actual line breaks, whereas &lt;CR, LF&gt; is treated like a hard line
            break. As soon as a user edits the text, the location of all the &lt;CR, CR, LF&gt;
            sequences may change as the new text breaks differently, while the relative
            position of any &lt;CR, LF&gt; to the surrounding text stays the same. This
            convention allows an editor to return a buffer and the client to tell which text is displayed on
            which line by counting the number of &lt;CR, CR, LF&gt; and &lt;CR, LF&gt; sequences.
            This convention is essentially equivalent to
            markup that captures the result of applying the line break algorithm, not a
            tailoring of the CR character. The &lt;CR, CR, LF&gt; sequences are thus not
            considered part of
            the plain text content.</p>

<h3><b><a name="GL" href="#GL">GL</a></b>: Non-breaking (“Glue”) (XB/XA) (Non-tailorable)</h3>
  <p>Non-breaking characters prohibit breaks on either
	side, but that prohibition can be overridden by <a class="charclass" href="#SP"> SP</a> or
      <a class="charclass" href="#ZW">ZW</a>.
	In particular, when NO-BREAK SPACE
        follows SPACE, there is a break opportunity after
	the SPACE and the NO-BREAK SPACE
        will go as visible space onto the next line.
	See also <a class="charclass" href="#WJ">WJ</a>. The following are examples of characters of line break

    </tr>
  </table>
<p>
   NO-BREAK SPACE is the preferred character to use where two words
   are to be visually separated but kept on the same line, as in the case of a title and a
   name “Dr.&lt;NBSP&gt;Joseph Becker”. When SPACE follows NO-BREAK SPACE,
   there is no break, because there never is a break in front of SPACE.</p>
<p><a name="NNBSPdoc"></a>NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE has exactly the same line breaking behavior
    as NO-BREAK SPACE,
    but with a narrow display width.
    The MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR
    acts like a NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE
    in its line breaking behavior. Both of these characters are regularly used in
    Mongolian text, where they participate in special shaping behavior,
    as described in <i>Section 13.5, Mongolian</i> of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
<p>
    When NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE
    occurs in French text, it should be interpreted as an “espace fine
    insécable”.</p>

  <p>This character has no visible glyph and its presence indicates that

	    Korean uses space-based line breaking in many styles of documents. To

      <h4>Symbols</h4>
        <p>Certain pictographic symbols of General Category So
           are also included in this line break class.</p>

<h3><b><a name="HL" href="#HL">HL</a></b>: Hebrew Letter (XB)</h3>
  <p>This class includes all Hebrew letters.</p>

  <p>When a Hebrew letter is followed by a hyphen, there is no break on either side of the hyphen.
     In this context a hyphen is any character of class <a class="charclass" href="#HY">HY</a>
     or class <a class="charclass" href="#BA">BA</a>.
     In other respects, Hebrew letters behave the same as characters of class
     <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>.</p>
     <p>Included in this class are all characters of General Category Letter that have Script=Hebrew.</p>


<h3><b><a name="IN" href="#IN">IN</a></b>: Inseparable Characters (XP)</h3>
  <h4>Leaders</h4>
  <p>These characters are intended to be used consecutively.
     There is never a line break between two characters of this class.</p>

  <p>Examples include:</p>

  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td class="nb-la">2024</td>

<h3><b><a name="IS" href="#IS">IS</a></b>: Infix Numeric Separator (XB)</h3>

  is subtly different from the others in this class, in that it is
  <i>both</i> an opening and a closing punctuation character at the same time.
  However, its use is limited to certain vertical text modes in terminal

<h3><b><a name="RI" href="#RI">RI</a></b>: Regional Indicator (B/A/XP)</h3>
    <p>For line Breaking, the Regional Indicator characters are

    <p> Runs of adjacent RI characters are grouped into pairs, begi<span class="removed">n</span>nning at the start of the run.
         No break opportunity occurs within a pair; breaks can occur between adjacent pairs.
         When RI characters are adjacent to characters of other classes, breaks can occur before and after,
         except where forbidden by other rules.</p>

<h3><b><a name="SA" href="#SA">SA</a></b>: Complex-Context Dependent (South East Asian) (P)</h3>
  <p>Runs of these characters require morphological analysis to determine break
    opportunities. This is similar to, for example, a hyphenation algorithm. For the
    characters that have this property, <strong>no</strong> break opportunities will be
    found otherwise. Therefore complex context analysis, often involving

<h3><b><a name="XX" href="#XX">XX</a></b>: Unknown (XP)</h3>
  <p>The <a class="charclass" href="#XX">XX</a> line break class consists of all characters with
      General_Category Co as well as those unassigned code points that are not within a CJK block.
      Unassigned characters in blocks or ranges of the Unicode codespace
       that have been reserved for CJK scripts default to the class <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a>,
       and are listed in the description of that class.</p>
   <p>Unassigned code positions, private-use characters, and characters for which
      reliable line breaking information is not available are assigned this
      line breaking property.  The default behavior for this class is identical to
      class  <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>.
      Users can manually insert ZWSP or WORD JOINER around
      characters of class <a class="charclass" href="#XX">XX</a> to allow or prevent breaks as needed.</p>
    <p>In addition, implementations can override or tailor this default behavior—for example,
      by assigning characters the property <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a> or another class.
      Doing so may give better default behavior for their users. There are
      other possible means of determining the desired behavior of private-use
      characters. For example, one implementation
      might treat any private-use character in ideographic context as <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a>,
      while another implementation might support a method for assigning specific
      properties to specific definitions of private-use characters. The details of
      such use of private-use characters are outside the scope of this standard.</p>
    <p>For supplementary characters, a useful default is to treat characters in the
      range 10000..1FFFD as <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a> and characters in the ranges
      20000..2FFFD and 30000..3FFFD as <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a>,
      until the implementation can be revised to take into
      account the actual line breaking properties for these characters.</p>

      characters, see the discussion on default property values in <i>Section

  <h3>5.2 <a name="Dictionary" href="#Dictionary">Dictionary Usage</a></h3>

  <p>Dictionaries follow specific conventions that guide their use of special characters to
    indicate features of the terms they list. Marks used for some of these
    conventions may occur near line break opportunities and therefore interact
    with line breaking. For example, in one dictionary a natural hyphen in a
    word becomes a tilde dash when the word is split.</p>
  <p>
    This subsection briefly describes conventions used in several dictionaries.
    Where possible, the line breaking properties
    for characters commonly used in dictionaries have been assigned to
    accommodate these and similar conventions by
    default. However, implementing the full conventions in dictionaries
    requires tailoring of line break classes and rules
    or other types of special support.</p>
  <p>Looking up the noun “syllable” in eight dictionaries yields eight
    different conventions:</p>
  <p><i>Dictionary of the English Language</i> (Samuel Johnson, 1843) <b>SY´LLABLE</b>
  where <b>´</b> is an oversized U+02B9 and follows the vowel of
  the main syllable (not the syllable itself).</p>
  <p><i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (1st Edition) <b>si·lă'bl</b> where ·
  is a slightly raised middle dot indicating the vowel of the stressed syllable
  (similar to Johnson&#x2019;s acute). The letter ă is U+0103. The ' is an
  apostrophe.</p>
  <p><i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2nd Edition) has gone to IPA <b>'sIləb(ə)l
 </b> where <b>'</b> is U+02C8, I is U+026A, and ə is U+0259 (both times). The <b>'</b>
  comes before the stressed syllable. The () indicate the <i>schwa</i> may be omitted.</p>
  <p><i>Chambers English Dictionary</i> (7th Edition) <b>sil´ə-bl</b> where the
	stressed syllable is followed by <b>´</b> U+02B9, ə is U+0259, and <b>-</b>
	is a hyphen. When splitting a word like <b>abate´- ment</b>, the stress mark <b>´</b>
	goes after stressed syllable followed by the hyphen. No special convention is
	used when splitting at hyphen.</p>
    <p><i>BBC English Dictionary</i> <b>sIləb<u>l</u></b> where <u>I</u> is &lt;U+026A, U+0332&gt;
	and ə is
	U+0259. The vowel of the stressed syllable is underlined.</p>
    <p><i>Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary</i> <b>sIləbə°<u>l</u></b> where
	<u>I</u>
	is &lt;U+026A, U+0332&gt; and has the same meaning as in the <i>BBC English Dictionary</i>. The ə is U+0259 (both times).
	The <b>°</b> is a U+2070 and indicates the <i>schwa</i> may be omitted.</p>
    <p><i>Readers Digest Great Illustrated Dictionary</i> <b>syl·la·ble</b> (<b>sílləb'l</b>)
	The spelling of the word has hyphenation points (· is a U+2027) followed by
	phonetic spelling. The vowel of the stressed syllable is given an accent, rather than being followed by an accent. The ' is an apostrophe.</p>
    <p><i>Webster’s 3rd New International Dictionary</i> <b>syl·la·ble</b>
	/<b>'siləbəl</b>/ The spelling of the word has hyphenation points (<b>·</b>
	is a U+2027) and is followed by phonetic spelling. The stressed syllable is
	preceded by <b>'</b> U+02C8. The ə’s are <i>schwas</i> as usual. <i>Webster’s</i> splits words
	at the end of a line with a normal hyphen. A U+2E17 DOUBLE OBLIQUE HYPHEN indicates that a hyphenated word is
	split at the hyphen.</p>
    <p>Some dictionaries use a character that looks like a vertical series of four
	dots to indicate places where there is a syllable, but no allowable break.
	This can be represented by a sequence
	of U+205E VERTICAL FOUR DOTS followed by U+2060 WORD JOINER.</p>

<h3>5.3 <a name="Hyphen" href="#Hyphen">Use of Hyphen</a></h3>

    <p>The rules for treating hyphens in line breaking
	vary by language. In many instances, these rules are not supported as such in the
	algorithm, but the correct appearance can be realized by using a<i>
	non-breaking hyphen.</i></p>
    <p>Some languages and some transliteration systems
	use a hyphen at the first position in a word. For example, the Finnish
	orthography uses a hyphen at the start of a word in certain types of
	compounds of the form xxx yyy -zzz (where xxx yyy is a two-word expression
	that acts as the first part of a compound noun, with zzz as the second
	part). Line break after the hyphen is not allowed here; therefore, instead of
	a regular hyphen, U+2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN should be used.</p>
    <p>There are line breaking conventions that
	modify the appearance of a line break when the line break opportunity is
	based on an explicit hyphen. In
	standard Polish orthography, explicit hyphens are always promoted to the
	next line if a line break occurs at that location in the text. For example,
	if, given the sentence &quot;Tam wisi czerwono-niebieska flaga&quot; (&quot;There
	hangs a red-blue flag&quot;), the optimal line break occurs at the location of
	the explicit hyphen, an additional hyphen
	will be displayed at the beginning of the next line like this:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Tam wisi czerwono- <br>
		-niebieska flaga.</p>
	</blockquote>
    <p>The same convention is used in Portuguese, where the use
	of hyphens is common, because they are mandatory for verb forms that include a
	pronoun. Homographs or ambiguity may arise if hyphens are treated
	incorrectly: for example, &quot;disparate&quot; means &quot;folly&quot; while &quot;dispara-te&quot; means &quot;fire
	yourself&quot; (or &quot;fires onto you&quot;). Therefore the former needs to be line
	broken as</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>dispara-<br>te</p>
	</blockquote>
    <p>and the latter as</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>dispara-<br>-te.</p>
	</blockquote>
    <p>A recommended practice is to type &lt;SHY,
	NON-BREAKING HYPHEN&gt; instead of &lt;HYPHEN&gt; to achieve promotion of the hyphen to the next
	line. This practice is reportedly already common and supported by major text
	layout applications. See also <i>Section 5.4,
	<a href="#SoftHyphen">Use of Soft Hyphen</a></i>.</p>

<h3>5.4 <a name="SoftHyphen" href="#SoftHyphen">Use of Soft Hyphen</a></h3>

  <p>Unlike U+2010 HYPHEN, which always has a visible rendition, the character
    U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN (SHY) is an invisible format character that merely indicates a
    preferred intraword line break position. If the line is broken at that point,
    then whatever mechanism is appropriate for intraword line breaks should be
    invoked, just as if the line break had been triggered by another hyphenation mechanism,
    such as a dictionary lookup. Depending on the language and the word, that
    may produce different visible results, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simply inserting a hyphen glyph</li>
    <li>Inserting a hyphen glyph and changing spelling in the divided word
      parts</li>
    <li>Not showing any visible change and simply breaking at that point</li>
    <li>Inserting a hyphen glyph at the beginning of the new line</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following are a few examples of spelling changes. Each example shows the line
	break as “ / ” and any inserted hyphens. There are many other cases.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In pre-reform German orthography, a “c” before the
      hyphenation point can change into a “k”: “Drucker”
      hyphenates into “Druk- / ker”.</li>
    <li>In modern Dutch, an <i>e-diaeresis</i> after the hyphenation point can
      change into a simple “e”: “geërfde” hyphenates
      into “ge- / erfde”, and “geëerd” into “ge-/ eerd”.</li>
    <li>In German and Swedish, a consonant is sometimes doubled: Swedish “tuggummi”;
      hyphenates into “tugg- / gummi”.</li>
    <li>In Dutch, a letter can disappear: “opaatje” hyphenates into
      “opa- / tje”.</li>
	</ul>
  <p>The inserted hyphen glyph can take a wide variety of shapes, as appropriate for the situation. Examples
      include shapes like U+2010 HYPHEN, U+058A ARMENIAN HYPHEN, U+180A MONGOLIAN
      NIRUGU, or U+1806 MONGOLIAN TODO SOFT HYPHEN.</p>
  <p>When a SHY is used to represent a possible hyphenation
      location, the spelling is that of the word without hyphenation:
      “tug&lt;SHY&gt;gummi”. It is up to the line breaking
      implementation to make any necessary spelling changes when such a possible
      hyphenation is actually used.</p>
  <p>Sometimes it is desirable to encode text that includes line breaking
    decisions and will not be further broken into lines. If
    such text includes hyphenations, the spelling needs to reflect the changes due to
    hyphenation: “tugg&lt;U+2010&gt;/ gummi”, including the appropriate
    character for any inserted hyphen. For a list of dash-like characters in
    Unicode, see <i>Section 6.2, General Punctuation</i>, in
    [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  <p>Hyphenation, and therefore the SHY, can be used
	with the Arabic script. If the rendering
	system breaks at that point, the display—including shaping—should be what
	is appropriate for the given language. For
	example, sometimes a hyphen-like mark is placed
		on the end of the line. This mark looks like a <i>kashida</i>, but is not
	connected to the letter preceding it. Instead, the
	appearance of the mark is as if it had been placed—and the line
	divided—after the contextual shapes for the line have been determined. For
	more information on shaping, see [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX9">UAX9</a>] and
	<i>Section 9.2, Arabic</i>, of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
	<p>There are three types of hyphens: explicit hyphens, conditional hyphens,
	and dictionary-inserted hyphens resulting from a hyphenation process. There
	is no character code for the third kind of hyphen. If a
	distinction is desired, the fact that a hyphen is dictionary-inserted and
	not user-supplied can only be
  represented out of band or by using another control code instead
  of SHY.</p>
  <p>The action of a hyphenation algorithm is equivalent to the insertion of a
  SHY. However, when a word contains an explicit SHY, it is customarily treated
  as overriding the action of the hyphenator for that word.</p>
	<p>The sequence &lt;SHY, NON-BREAKING HYPHEN&gt;
    is given a particular interpretation, see
	<i>Section 5.3, <a href="#Hyphen">Use of Hyphen</a></i>.</p>

<h3>5.5 <a name="DoubleHyphen" href="#DoubleHyphen">Use of Double Hyphen</a></h3>

	<p>In some fonts, notably  Fraktur fonts, it is customary to use a double-stroke form
        of the hyphen, usually oblique. Such use is a font-based
	glyph variation and does not affect line breaking in any way. In texts using
	such a font, automatic hyphenation or SHY would also result in the display
	of a double-stroke, oblique hyphen.</p>
    <p>In some dictionaries, such as <i>Webster’s 3rd New International Dictionary</i>,
	double-stroke, oblique hyphens are used to indicate
	an explicit hyphen at the end of the line; in other words, a hyphen that
	would be retained when the term shown is not line wrapped.
	It is not necessary to store a special character in the data to support
	this option; one merely needs to substitute the glyph of any ordinary hyphen that winds up
	at the end of a line. In this example, if the shape of the special hyphen matches an existing
	character, such as U+2E17 DOUBLE OBLIQUE HYPHEN,
	that character can be substituted temporarily for display purposes by the line formatter.
	With such a convention, automatic hyphenation or
	SHY would result in the display of an ordinary hyphen without further
	substitution. (See also <i>Section 5.3, <a href="#Hyphen">Use of Hyphen</a></i>).</p>
    <p>Certain linguistic notations make use of a double-stroke, oblique hyphen
	to indicate specific features. The U+2E17 DOUBLE OBLIQUE HYPHEN
	character used in this case is not a hyphen
	and does not represent a line break opportunity. Automatic hyphenation or
	SHY would result in the display of an ordinary hyphen.</p>
    <p>U+30A0 KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN is used in scientific
	notation, for example, to mark the presence of a space that would otherwise
	have been lost in transcribing text, such as the name of a chemical
	compound, into Katakana. In such notation, ordinary hyphens are retained.</p>

<h3>5.6 <a name="TibetanLinebreaking" href="#TibetanLinebreaking">Tibetan Line Breaking</a></h3>

    <p>The Tibetan script uses spaces sparingly,
	relying instead on the <i>tsheg</i>. There is no punctuation equivalent to a
	period in Tibetan; Tibetan <i>shad</i> characters indicate the end of a
	phrase, not a sentence. Phrases are often metrical—that is, written
	after every <i>N</i> syllables—and a new sentence can often start within the
	middle of a phrase. Sentence boundaries need to be determined
	grammatically rather than by punctuation.</p>
    <p>Traditionally there is nothing akin to a
	paragraph in Tibetan text. It is typical to have many pages of text
	without a paragraph break—that is, without an explicit line break.
	The closest thing to a paragraph in Tibetan is a
	new section or topic starting with U+0F12 or U+0F08. However, these occur
	inline: one section ends and a new one starts on the same line, and the new
	section is marked only by the presence of one of these characters.</p>
    <p>Some modern books, newspapers, and magazines
	format text more like English with a break before each section or topic—and (often)
	the title of the section on a separate line. Where this is done,
	authors insert an explicit line break. Western punctuation (full stop,
	question mark, exclamation mark, comma, colon, semicolon, quotes) is
	starting to appear in Tibetan documents, particularly those published in
	India, Bhutan, and Nepal. Because there are no formal rules for their use in
	Tibetan, they get treated generically by default. In Tibetan documents
	published in China, CJK bracket and punctuation characters occur frequently;
	it is recommended to treat these as in horizontally written Chinese.</p>
	<blockquote>
	    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> The detailed rules for formatting Tibetan texts are
	    complex, and the original assignment of line break classes was found to be insufficient.

	    break classes for Tibetan was revised significantly in an attempt to
	    better model Tibetan line breaking behavior. No new rules or line break
	    classes were added.</p>
	</blockquote>
    <p>The set of line break classes for Tibetan is expected to provide a good starting
	point, even though there is limited practical experience in their
	implementation. As more experience is gained, some modifications, possibly
	including new rules or additional line break classes, can be expected.</p>

<h3>5.7 <a name="WordSeparators" href="#WordSeparators">Word Separator Characters</a></h3>

    <p>Visible word separator
	characters may behave in one of three ways at line breaks. As an example,
	consider the text “The:quick:brown:fox:jumped.”, where the colon (:)
	represents a visible word separator, with a break between “brown” and “fox”.
	The desired visual appearance could be one of the following:</p>
    <p>1. suppress the visible word separator</p>
	<blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The:quick:brown<br>
			fox:jumped.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<p>2. break before the visible word separator</p>
	<blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The:quick:brown<br>
			:fox:jumped.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<p>3. break after the visible word separator</p>
	<blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The:quick:brown:<br>
			fox:jumped.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
    <p>Both (2) and (3) can be
	expressed with the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm by tailoring the Line
	Break property value for the word separator character to be <a href="#BB"> Break Before</a>
	or <a href="#BA">Break After</a>, respectively.</p>
    <p>For case (1), the line break
	opportunity is positioned after the word separator character, as in case
	(3), but the visual display of the character is suppressed. The means
	by which a line layout and display process inhibits the visible display of
	the separator character are outside of the scope of the Line Break
	algorithm. U+1680 OGHAM SPACE MARK is an example of a character which may
	exhibit this behavior.</p>

<h2>6 <a name="Algorithm" href="#Algorithm">Line Breaking Algorithm</a></h2>

  <p>Unicode Standard Annex #29, “Unicode Text Segmentation” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>],
     describes a particular method for
      boundary detection, based on a set of hierarchical rules
      and character classifications. That method is well suited for
      implementation of some of the advanced heuristics for line breaking.</p>
    <p>The line breaking algorithm presented in this section can be expressed in a
      series of rules that take line breaking classes defined in
      <i>Section 5.1, <a href="#DescriptionOfProperties">Description of Line Breaking Properties</a></i>, as input.
	The title of each rule contains a mnemonic summary of the main effect of the
	rule. The formal statement of each line breaking rules consists either of a
	remap rule or of one or more regular expressions containing one or more
	line breaking classes and one of three special symbols indicating the type
	of line break opportunity:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>! Mandatory break at the indicated position</p>
    <p>× No break allowed at the indicated position</p>
    <p>÷ Break allowed at the indicated position</p>
  </blockquote>
	<p>In the regular expressions, parentheses may be used for grouping, 
    and square brackets, &amp;,  -, and \p{...} may be used to compose sets of characters, 
    as in UAX #29, <i>Unicode Text Segmentation</i> [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>] and in 
    UTS #18, <i>Unicode Regular Expressions</i> [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>]. 
    Use of a line break class such as <a class="charclass" href="#BK">BK</a> is short 
    for the property expression \p{lb=<a class="charclass" href="#BK">BK</a>}.</p>
  	<p>The rules are applied in order. That is, there is an implicit “otherwise”
	at the front of each rule following the first. It is possible to construct
	alternate sets of such rules that are fully equivalent. To be equivalent, an
	alternate set of rules must have the same effect.</p>
  <p>The distinction between a direct break and an indirect break as defined in
	<i>Section 2, <a href="#Definitions">Definitions</a></i>, is handled in rule
        <a class="charclass" href="#LB18">LB18</a>,
	which explicitly considers the effect of <a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a>.
        Because rules are applied in order, allowing breaks following
        <a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a> in rule <a class="charclass" href="#LB18">LB18</a>
        implies that any prohibited break in rules
        <a class="charclass" href="#LB19">LB19</a>–<a class="charclass" href="#LB30">LB30</a>
        is equivalent to an indirect break.</p>
  <p>The examples for each rule use representative characters, where ‘H’ stands for an ideographs,
	‘h’ for small kana, and ‘9’ for digits.
	Except where a rule contains no expressions, the italicized text of the rule
	is intended merely as a handy summary.	</p>
  <p>The algorithm consists of a part for which
	tailoring is prohibited and a freely tailorable part.</p>

  	<p><b><i>Start and end of text:</i></b></p>
        <p>There are two special logical positions: <b>sot</b>, which occurs before the first character in the text, and
	<b>eot,</b> which occurs after the last character in the text. Thus an
	empty string would consist of <b>sot</b> followed immediately by <b>eot</b>. With these
	two definitions, the line break rules for start and end of text can be
	specified as follows:</p>

<p class="rule"><a name="LB2" href="#LB2"></a><b>LB2</b> Never break at the start of text.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center">sot ×</p>

<p class="rule"><a name="LB3" href="#LB3"></a><b>LB3</b> Always break at the end of text.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center">! eot</p>
  <p>These two rules are designed to deal with degenerate cases, so that there
	is at least one character on each line, and at least one line break for
  the whole text. Emergency line breaking behavior usually also allows line
  breaks anywhere on the line if a legal line break cannot be found. This has
  the effect of preventing text from running into the margins.</p>
  <p><b><i>Mandatory breaks:</i></b></p>
  <p>A hard line break can consist of <a class="charclass" href="#BK">BK</a> or a Newline

<h3>6.2 <a name="TailorableBreakingRules" href="#TailorableBreakingRules">Tailorable Line Breaking Rules</a></h3>

  <p>The following rules and the classes referenced in them provide a reasonable
	  default set of line break opportunities.  Implementations should implement them
	  unless alternate approaches produce better results for some classes of
	  text or applications.  When using alternative rules or algorithms, implementations
	  must ensure that the mandatory breaks, break opportunities and non-break positions
	  determined by the algorithm and rules of <i>Section 6.1, <a href="#BreakingRules">Non-tailorable Line Breaking Rules</a></i>,
	   are preserved. See
	<i>Section 4, <a href="#Conformance">Conformance</a></i>.</p>
	<p><b><i>Non-breaking characters:</i></b></p>

<p class="rule"><a name="LB12a" href="#LB12a"></a><b>LB12a</b> Do not break before NBSP and related characters,
	 except after spaces and hyphens.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center">[^SP BA HY] × GL</p>
	<p style="text-align:left">The expression [^SP,
	BA, HY] designates any line break class other than
	<a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a>, <a class="charclass" href="#BA">BA</a>

	to avoid confusion with the use of ! to indicate an explicit break. Unlike the case for
	<a class="charclass" href="#WJ">WJ</a>, inserting a
	<a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a> overrides the non-breaking nature of
	a <a class="charclass" href="#GL">GL</a>. Allowing
	a break after <a class="charclass" href="#BA">BA</a> or

<h2>8 <a name="Customization" href="#Customization">Customization</a></h2>

  <p>A real-world line breaking algorithm has to be tailorable to some degree to meet
  user or document requirements.</p>

  <p>In Korean, for example, two distinct line breaking modes occur,
    which can be summarized as breaking after each character or breaking after spaces
    (as in Latin text). The former tends to occur when text is set justified; the latter, when
    ragged margins are used. In that case, even ideographs are broken only at space
    characters. In Japanese, for example, tighter and looser specifications of prohibited line breaks
    may be used.</p>

	<p>Specialized text or specialized text constructs may need specific line
	breaking behavior that differs from the default line breaking rules given in
	this annex. This may require additional tailorings beyond those considered
	in this section. For example, the rules given here are insufficient for
	mathematical equations, whether inline or in display format. Likewise, text
	that commonly contains lengthy URLs might benefit from special tailoring that suppresses
	<a class="charclass" href="#SY">SY</a> × <a class="charclass" href="#NU">NU</a>
	from rule <a class="charclass" href="#LB25">LB25</a> within the scope of a
	URL to allow breaks after a “/” separated segment in the URL regardless of
	whether the next segment starts with a digit.</p>

    <p>The remainder of this section gives an overview of common types of tailorings.</p>

  <h3>8.1 <a name="Tailoring" href="#Tailoring">Types of Tailoring</a></h3>

  <p>There are two principal ways of tailoring 
	the line breaking algorithm:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Changing the line breaking class assignment for some characters</b><br>
	This is useful in cases where the line breaking properties of one class of
      characters are occasionally lumped together with the properties of another
      class to achieve a less restrictive line breaking behavior.
    </li>
    <li><b>Changing the line breaking rules</b><br>
      Adding new rules, or altering or removing existing rules, provides more flexibility in
      changing the line breaking behavior. This can also include introducing new character classes
      for use by the new or altered rules.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Beyond these three straightforward customization steps, it is always
  possible to augment the algorithm itself—for example, by providing specialized
  rules to recognize and break common constructs, such as URLs, numeric
	expressions, and so on. Such open-ended customizations place no limits on possible changes, other than the
	requirement that characters with normative line breaking properties be
	correctly implemented.</p>

  <h3>8.2 <a name="Examples" href="#Examples">Examples of Customization</a></h3>

    <p><b><i>Example 1.</i></b>
        The exact method of resolving the line break class for
        characters with class <a class="charclass" href="#SA">SA</a> is not
        specified in the default algorithm. One method of implementing line breaks for complex
        scripts is to invoke context-based classification for all runs of characters
        with class <a class="charclass" href="#SA">SA</a>. For example, a dictionary-based algorithm could return
        different classes for Thai letters depending on their context: letters at the
        start of Thai words would become <a class="charclass" href="#BB">BB</a> and other Thai letters would become
        <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>. Alternatively, for text consisting of,
        or predominantly containing characters with line breaking class <a class="charclass" href="#SA">SA</a>,
        it may be useful to instead defer the determination of line breaks to a
        different algorithm.</p>
    <p><b><i>Example 2.</i>
        </b> To implement terminal style line breaks, it would be necessary to allow
        breaks at fixed positions. These could occur
        inside a run of spaces or in the middle of words without regard to
        hyphenation. Such a modification essentially disregards the output of
        the line breaking algorithm, and is therefore not a conformant tailoring. For
        a system that supports both regular line breaking and terminal style line
        breaks, only some of its line break modes would be conformant.</p>
    <p><b><i>Example 3.</i></b>
        Depending on the nature of the document, Korean either uses implicit breaking around characters
        (type 2 as defined in <i>Section 3, <a href="#Introduction">Introduction</a></i>) or uses spaces (type 1).
        Space-based layout is common in magazines and other informal documents with ragged margins,
        while books, with both margins justified, use the other type, as
        it affords more line break opportunities and therefore leads to better
        justification.</p>
<p><b><i>Example 4.</i>
    </b>In a Far Eastern context it is sometimes necessary to allow alphabetic characters and digit strings to break anywhere.
    According to reference [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Suign98">Suign98</a>],
    this can again be done in the same way as Korean. 
    This can be implemented by adjusting rules <a class="charclass" href="#LB23">LB23</a>,
    <a class="charclass" href="#LB25">LB25</a> and <a class="charclass" href="#LB28">LB28</a>
    to allow breaks between all permutations of the character classes
     <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a> and <a class="charclass" href="#NU">NU</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Example 5.</i>
      </b>Some users prefer to relax the requirement that Kana syllables be kept
      together. For example, the syllable <i>kyu,</i> spelled with the two kanas <i>KI</i>
      and “small <i>yu</i>”, would no longer be kept together as if <i>KI</i> and <i>yu</i>
      were atomic. This customization can be handled by
      mapping class <a class="charclass" href="#CJ">CJ</a> to be handled as class <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a>
      in rule <a class="charclass" href="#LB1">LB1</a>.</p>

<p><b><i>Example 6.</i></b> Tailor to prevent line breaks from falling within default grapheme
        clusters, as defined by by  Unicode Standard Annex #29, “Unicode Text Segmentation”
        [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>]. The tailoring can be accomplished by
        first segmenting the text into grapheme clusters according to the rules defined
        in UAX #29, and then finding line breaks according to the default line break rules,
        giving each grapheme cluster the line breaking class of its first code point.</p>
        <p>An example of a grapheme cluster that would be split by the default line break
        rules is a Zero Width Space followed by a combining mark.</p>

<p><b><i><a name="Example7" href="#Example7"></a>Example 7.</i>
    </b> Regular expression-based line breaking engines might get better results
	using a tailoring that directly implements the following regular expression
	for numeric expressions:</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">( <a class="charclass" href="#PR">PR</a> | <a class="charclass" href="#PO">PO</a>)  ?
            ( <a class="charclass" href="#OP">OP</a>  | <a class="charclass" href="#HY">HY</a>  ) ?
            <a class="charclass" href="#NU">NU</a>
                (<a class="charclass" href="#NU">NU</a> | <a class="charclass" href="#SY">SY</a>  | <a class="charclass" href="#IS">IS</a>) *
            ( <a class="charclass" href="#CL">CL</a> | <a class="charclass" href="#CP">CP</a> ) ?
	    ( <a class="charclass" href="#PR">PR</a> | <a class="charclass" href="#PO">PO</a>) ?
        </p>
  	<p>This is equivalent
	to replacing the rule <a class="charclass" href="#LB25">LB25</a>
	by the following tailored rule:</p>
	<p class="rule"><i>Regex-Number: Do not
	break numbers.</i></p>
	<p style="text-align:center">(PR | PO) × ( OP | HY )? NU</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">( OP | HY ) × NU</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">NU × (NU | SY | IS)</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">NU (NU | SY | IS)* × (NU | SY | IS | CL  | CP )</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">NU (NU | SY | IS)* (CL | CP)? × (PO | PR)</p>
  	<p>In these tailored rules, (PR | PO) means
	<a class="charclass" href="#PR">PR</a> or <a class="charclass" href="#PO">PO</a>,
	the Symbol “?” means 0 or one occurrence and the symbol “*” means 0 or more
	occurrences. The last two rules can have a left side of any non-zero length.</p>
	<p>When the tailored rule is used, <a class="charclass" href="#LB13">LB13</a>
	need to be tailored as follows:</p>
		  <p style="text-align:center">[^NU] × CL</p>
		  <p style="text-align:center">[^NU] × CP</p>
		  <p style="text-align:center">× EX</p>
		  <p style="text-align:center">[^NU] × IS</p>
		  <p style="text-align:center">[^NU] × SY</p>
    <p>If this is not done,
	single digits might be handled by rule <a class="charclass" href="#LB13">LB13</a>
	before being handled in the regular expression. In these tailored rules [^NU] designates any
	line break class other than <a class="charclass" href="#NU">NU</a>. The
	symbol ^ is used, instead of !, to avoid confusion with the use of
	! to indicate an explicit break.</p>

    <p><b><i>Example 8.</i></b> For some implementations it may be difficult to
	implement <a class="charclass" href="#LB9">LB9</a> due to the added complexity of its indefinite length
	context. Because combining marks are most commonly applied to characters of
        class <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a>, rule <a class="charclass" href="#LB10">LB10</a>
	by itself generally produces acceptable results for such implementations,
	but such an approximation is not a conformant tailoring.</p>
	

<h2>9 <a name="ImplementationNotes" href="#ImplementationNotes">Implementation Notes</a></h2>

	<p>This section provides additional notes on implementation issues.</p>

  <h3>9.1 <a name="RegExCombining" href="#RegExCombining">Combining Marks in Regular Expression-Based Implementations</a></h3>

	<p>
	    Implementations that use regular expressions cannot directly
	    express rules <a class="charclass" href="#LB9">LB9</a> and <a class="charclass" href="#LB10">LB10</a>.
	    However, it is possible to make these rules unnecessary by rewriting <i>all</i>
	    the rules from <a class="charclass" href="#LB11">LB11</a> on down so that the
	    overall result of the algorithm is unchanged. This restatement of the rules is
	    therefore not a tailoring, but rather an equivalent statement of the algorithm
	    that can be directly expressed as regular expressions.</p>
	    <p>To replace rule <a class="charclass" href="#LB9">LB9</a>, terms of
	    the form</p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><b>B</b> # <b>A</b></p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><b>B</b> SP* # <b>A</b></p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><b>B</b> #</p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><b>B</b> SP* #</p>
		<p>are replaced by terms of the form</p>
			<p style="text-align: center"><b>B</b> CM* # <b>A</b></p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><b>B</b> CM* SP* # <b>A</b></p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><b>B</b> CM* #</p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><b>B</b> CM* SP* #</p>
    <p>where <b>B</b> and <b>A</b> are any line break class or set of
    alternate line break classes, such as (X |Y), and where # is any of the three
    operators !, ÷, or ×.</p>
    <p>Note that because <b>sot</b>, <a class="charclass" href="#BK">BK</a>, <a class="charclass" href="#CR">CR</a>, <a class="charclass" href="#LF">LF</a>, <a class="charclass" href="#NL">NL</a>, and <a class="charclass" href="#ZW">ZW</a> are all handled by rules
    above <a class="charclass" href="#LB9">LB9</a>, these classes cannot occur in
    position <b>B</b> in any rule that is rewritten as shown here.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left">Replace <a class="charclass" href="#LB10">LB10</a>
    by the following rule:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">× CM</p>
    <p>For each rule containing AL on its left side,
    add a rule that is identical except for the replacement of AL by CM, but taking
    care of correctly handling sets of alternate line break classes. For example,
    for rule</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">(AL | NU) × OP</p>
    <p style="text-align: left">add another rule</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">CM × OP.</p>
    <p>These prescriptions for rewriting the rules are, in
    principle, valid
    even where the rules have been tailored as permitted in <i>Section 4,
    <a href="#Conformance">Conformance</a></i>. However, for extended context rules
    such as in <a href="#Example7">Example 7</a>, additional
    considerations apply. These are described in <i>Section 6.2, Replacing Ignore Rules</i>, of
    Unicode Standard Annex #29, “Unicode Text Segmentation” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>].</p>

<h3>9.2 <a name="LegacySpace" href="#LegacySpace">Legacy Support for Space Character as Base for Combining Marks</a></h3>

    <p>As stated in <i>Section 7.9, Combining Marks</i> of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>],
    combining characters are shown in isolation by applying them to U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE (NBSP).
    In earlier versions, this recommendation included the use of U+0020 SPACE.
    The use of SPACE for this purpose has been deprecated
    because it leads to many complications in text processing.  The visual appearance is the same with
    both NO-BREAK SPACE and SPACE,
    but the line breaking behavior is different.
    Under the current rules, <a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a> <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM*</a>
    will allow a break between <a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a> and
    <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM*</a>, which could result in a new line starting with a combining mark. Previously,
    whenever the base character was <a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a>, the sequences
    <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM*</a>
      and <a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a> <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM*</a>
      were defined to act like indivisible clusters,
      allowing breaks on either side like <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a>.</p>

    <p>Where backward compatibility with documents created under the prior
      practice is desired, the following tailoring should be applied to those
      <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM </a>characters that have a General_Category value of Combining_Mark (M):</p>

    <p><i>Legacy-CM: In all of the rules following rule <a class="charclass" href="#LB8">LB8</a>,
            if a space is the base character for a
	    combining mark, the space is changed to type <a class="charclass" href="#ID"> ID</a>.
	    In other words, break before <a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a>
	    in the same cases as one would break before an <a class="charclass" href="#ID"> ID</a>.</i></p>

      <p style="text-align:center">Treat <a class="charclass" href="#SP">SP</a> <a class="charclass" href="#CM">CM*</a>
        as if it were <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a>.</p>

    <p>While this tailoring changes the location of the line break
        opportunities in the string, it is ordinarily not expected to affect the display of
        the text. That is because spaces at the end of the line are normally
        invisible and the recommended display for isolated combining marks is the
        same as if they were applied to a preceding SPACE
        or NBSP.</p>

<h2>10 <a name="Testing" href="#Testing">Testing</a></h2>

	<p>As with the other default specifications,
	implementations are free to override (tailor) the results to meet the
	requirements of different environments or particular languages as described in
	<i>Section 4, <a href="#Conformance">Conformance</a></i>. For those
	who do implement the default breaks as specified in this annex, plus the
        tailoring of numbers described in Example 7 of
        <i>Section 8.2, <a href="#Examples">Examples of Customization</a></i>, and wish
        to check that that their implementation matches that specification, a
	test file has been made available in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Tests14">Tests14</a>].</p>
	<p>These tests cannot be exhaustive, because of the large number of possible
	combinations; but they do provide samples that test all pairs of property
	values, using a representative character for each value, plus certain other
	sequences.</p>

	<p>A sample HTML file is also available for each that shows various
	combinations in chart form, in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-26.html#Charts14">Charts14</a>].
        The header cells of the chart
	consist of a property value, followed by a representative code point number.
	The body cells in the chart show the break status: whether a break occurs
	between the row property value and the column property value. If the browser
	supports tool-tips, then hovering the mouse over the code point number will
	show the character name, General_Category and Script property
	values. Hovering over the break status will display the number of the rule
	responsible for that status.</p>
	<blockquote>
            <p><span class="note">Note:</span> To determine a break it is generally not sufficient to
                            just test the two adjacent characters.</p>
        </blockquote>
	<p>The chart is followed by some test cases. These test cases consist of
	various strings with the break status between each pair of characters shown
	by blue lines for breaks and by whitespace for non-breaks. Hovering over
	each character (with tool-tips enabled) shows the character name and
	property value; hovering over the break status shows the number of the rule
	responsible for that status.</p>
	<p>Due to the way they have been mechanically processed for generation, the
	test rules do not match the rules in this annex precisely. In particular:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The rules are cast into a more regex-style.</li>
		<li>The rules “sot”, “eot”, and “Any” are added
                    mechanically and have artificial numbers.</li>
		<li>The rules are given decimal numbers without prefixes,
                    so rules such as LB14 are given a number using tenths, such as 14.0.</li>
		<li>Where a rule has multiple parts (lines), each one is numbered using
                    hundredths, such as
		<ul>
			<li>13.01) [^NU] × CL</li>
			<li>13.02) × EX</li>
			<li>...</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>LB9 and LB10
		are handled as described in <i>Section 9.1,
		  <a href="#RegExCombining">Combining Marks in Regular Expression-Based Implementations</a></i>,
		resulting in a transformation of the rules not visible in the tests.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The mapping from the rule numbering in this annex to the numbering for
	the test rules is summarized in <i>Table 4</i>.</p>

  <p>Asmus Freytag created the initial version of this
  annex and maintained the text for many years. Andy Heninger 
  maintained the
  text from 2008 through 2019.</p>
	<p>The initial assignments of properties are based on input by Michel
     Suignard. Mark Davis provided algorithmic verification and formulation of the
     rules, and detailed suggestions on the algorithm and text. Ken Whistler, Rick McGowan
     and other members of the editorial committee
     provided valuable feedback. Tim Partridge enlarged the information on
     dictionary usage. Sun Gi Hong reviewed the information on Korean and provided
     copious printed samples. Eric Muller reanalyzed the behavior of the soft hyphen
     and collected the samples. Adam Twardoch provided the Polish example.
     António Martins-Tuválkin supplied information about Portuguese. Tomoyuki
     Sadahiro provided information on use of U+30A0. Christopher Fynn provided the background
     information on Tibetan line breaking. Andrew West, Kamal Mansour, Andrew Glass,
     Daniel Yacob, and Peter Kirk suggested improvements for Mongolian, Arabic,
     Kharoshthi, Ethiopic, and Hebrew punctuation characters, respectively.
     Kent Karlsson reviewed the line break properties for consistency.
     Jerry Hall reviewed the sample code. Elika J. Etemad (fantasai)
     reviewed the entire document in an effort to make it easier to reference from
     external standards. Many
     others provided additional review of the rules and property assignments.</p>
